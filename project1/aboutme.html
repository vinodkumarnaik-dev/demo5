    <title>ABOUT ME</title>
    <P>
        i am m . vinodkumarnaik from codegnan.
        
        Hi! I'm a passionate and curious individual with a love for technology and creativity. Whether I'm writing code, solving problems, or exploring new tools, I'm always eager to learn and grow.
        
        I'm currently focused on building cool projects that blend functionality with simplicity â€” from console apps to sleek websites. I enjoy turning ideas into reality and believe in continuous learning as a way of life.
        
        Outside of tech, I enjoy listening to music, watching movies, and discovering new things that spark inspiration.
