            "automatic certification using open cv"This project is designed to automate the process of verifying certificates using computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR). It utilizes OpenCV and Tesseract to extract text and key details from scanned certificates, such as the candidate's name, course title, date of issuance, and institution logo or signature. The extracted data is then cross-verified with a pre-existing database of authorized records.
             By combining text recognition, QR code scanning, and template/logo verification, this system can effectively detect manipulated or fake certificates, reducing manual workload and ensuring authenticity.
