    <strong>1.python</strong>
    This Python-based project is designed to automate the verification process of digital or scanned certificates using image processing and text recognition techniques. It leverages OpenCV for image handling and Tesseract OCR to extract textual content such as the recipient's name, course title, issue date, and more.

Additionally, it supports QR code scanning using Pyzbar to retrieve encoded certificate IDs for cross-verification. The extracted data is validated against a pre-defined list of genuine entries stored in a CSV or SQLite database, helping detect fake or altered certificates efficiently.
<strong>2.html</strong>
The HTML frontend is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading and verifying certificates. It serves as the visual component of the Automatic Certificate Verification System, allowing users to interact with the verification process through a clean and accessible webpage.

The page enables users to upload scanned certificates (images or PDFs), view the extracted details (like name, certificate ID, course, etc.), and see the verification result in real time. This front-facing layer is ideal for integration with a Python backend that performs the actual processing and validation.

<strong>3.css</strong>
    The CSS component of the Automatic Certificate Verification System is responsible for crafting a modern, clean, and responsive user interface. It enhances the user experience by applying styles to HTML elements such as upload forms, result displays, buttons, and layout containers.

    Using modern design principles, the CSS ensures that the application is visually appealing and intuitive across devices. From smooth hover effects to adaptive layouts, this styling layer ensures that the verification platform looks professional and trustworthy.
    
<strong>4.java script</strong>
The JavaScript component adds interactivity and client-side logic to the Automatic Certificate Verification System. It enhances the HTML/CSS frontend by managing user interactions such as certificate file uploads, previewing the uploaded image or PDF, and displaying dynamic results returned from the backend (e.g., verification status).

JavaScript is also used to validate file types, show loading indicators during processing, and update the UI based on verification outcomes. This makes the user experience smoother, faster, and more responsive without requiring full page reloads.
